I was not satisfied with the design of my last portfolio, so I decided to do a complete redesign using React and Bootstrap. 

It is always a work in progress, but I finally feel comfortable deploying it. Any comments or advice is always appreciated!

The following sites not only gave me ideas, but tutorials on how to implement animation effects I was interesed in.
